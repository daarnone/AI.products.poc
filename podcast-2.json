Hello and welcome to the Saxo Market Call. It's Tuesday, 22nd of August 2023. A very odd session yesterday in some ways as we see a resurgence in yields at the long end of the curve. Also at the short end I should note the two-year closing near 5% in the US. There were only two closes above 5% and both of those just prior to that March banking turmoil. We had the 10-year and the 30-year new high closes for the cycle, the 10-year since all the way back in 2007. And yet we look over the equity market and there was a huge speculative burst yesterday supposedly on improved risk sentiment, etc. Looks a little bit to me like maybe some shenanigans ahead of some very key earnings reports, especially Nvidia reporting tomorrow after the close. So we saw both Nvidia and what we call the speculative cluster around some of this AI, these AI linked names, also Tesla, but even the broader market was higher yesterday. And I'm not exactly sure what to attribute that to. You could always link some of these moves with things like touting that the analysts were upping their price targets. Is it really worth Peter gunning into fresh longs just ahead of an earnings report based on what analysts are saying? It feels like the volatility risks around this Nvidia are tremendous, certainly in both directions as we made clear yesterday. So I don't know your thoughts on that and or maybe you want to pick up the Nvidia talk specifically later. I would not put too much faith into what analysts are thinking about Nvidia because keep in mind that before the blowout out that they reported last time, Nvidia analysts had for two or three months, despite galloping user numbers for open AI and everything that came from Google with their bad engine, etc. Analysts were keeping their forward estimates on revenue completely flat as a pancake going into that earning. And so I mean, I don't trust their ability to read anything from from what's going on in the industry. So but we'll talk a little bit about Baidu because Baidu is is potentially one of the very big buyers of GPUs right now for Nvidia. They will be ported later today, but I have a few comments on that. But otherwise, I think if you look at the session as a whole, it was a big day for cyclicals that we again displaying this chart cyclical sectors versus defensive. The reason why we have a little bit more focus on this time series than normal is because of our stagflation light call where if that comes true, defensive sectors would do better. And even if we have a slowdown, I know a lot of indicators are not suggesting that and not for all economies at least then the vendor sectors, defensive sectors should do better. But yesterday was a big day for cyclicals. 1.2% outperformance on a relative basis there. So that was quite considerable. Otherwise, yeah, I think in equities, we also reacting to that new breakout, that new highs in the US 10 year yield. Let's definitely talk about that. I mean, it impacts all the capital intensive industries and sectors in the equity market. And I think the part of the equity might have been hit the hardest by these rising interest rates have not interesting enough, not been construction. Our theme basket in construction is actually doing quite well. It's been the green transformation has been all these very heavy capital intensive industries related to the green transformation. I think if we have a move higher in the bond yields from here, I could get actually pretty, I don't know, crunch time maybe for these green transformation stocks. All right. And you talk about stagflation call, the run rate of the Atlanta GDP now for Q3 is at over 5.7%. So, yeah, we need to see some worrying numbers at some point to start to get that call right directionally. We think, of course, we're going to get that. But at the moment, it does appear the economy is running fairly hot. I don't get that number. When I look at the Chicago Fed National Activity Index, which tracks 85 figures, it's around just below zero. So trend growth, I just I can't really square it with a 5% annualized GDP growth. But there could be some interesting GDP price index inputs into that. Yeah, of course. That also were the reason the Q2 GDP estimates sort of flattered what the actual state of growth was in the US. I think it came in well below what was expected. And of course, that means if you say the GDP price index is only growing very slightly when the non-economy otherwise grew a lot, then you get a different very different GDP. Interesting, regardless, there have been the one of the Citibank measures of US economic data is definitely beating very strongly on expectations. All right. So a couple of things here. We have these yields going higher yesterday and the US yields are dragging European yields higher. And so I point out on slide four, simply because the move was the biggest there with the strong sentiment. So despite those higher US yields, the strong sentiment meant that the dollar was a little bit on its back foot. The yen even more so because, of course, the yen is so yield sensitive. And so your yen hitting a new high since 2008 yesterday on the close above 159. And the direction is clear there unless either the Bank of Japan or Japan signals a policy move or if yields otherwise would have to start going back lower again. So pointing out that. But the dollar was generally soft, but nothing decisive enough to really to really start to draw conclusions. And so I'll say on yields yesterday with this new high close, we have to consider, you know, is this is this move going to continue? And you bring in this very interesting aspect into the picture on the US yield curve that you have a 10 year benchmark that's at four point three three percent ish right here. And the 30 years, 12 basis points higher in between that sits the 20 year, which is curiously higher than both of those at four point six four. So you need to explain to us why there's this weird kink at the long run of the US yield curve, as well as your general perspective here on what you are set to do next. Well, John, the simple reason why there is a premium when you buy 20 year US treasuries is because they are the most illiquid maturities out there. These these notes have been introduced on the back of the pandemic in 2020. They were discontinued at the beginning of the 90s. I think it was 94, something like that. So it has been there is very little 20 year issuance out there. And obviously, normally investors will always pick the most liquid issuance. So they would go 30 if they want to buy duration or they would go 10 if they want to buy the safe haven. So what's happening here is that tomorrow we have US issuance, US auction for 20 year notes. And the problem with that is that the auction has been increased by one billion dollars. That's much less compared to the amount that the 10 years and the 30 years have been increased by. But the problem is that if we don't have enough investors wanting to increase duration in their portfolio, then we might end up with very weak bidding metrics and that can spark further volatility in US treasuries. And we might see yields higher. I'm going to take you on slide number six, because here I tried to show some bidding metrics for the four and a half basically yields behave surrounding the 20 year US treasury auction. And what happens? I'm looking in October 2022. There we had a very weak indirect demand below 68 times. And what happened then is that we have seen a huge sell off, not only in 20 years, but across the yield curve. The yield on the 20 year notes increased by 30 basis point in just two trading sessions after the US treasury auction. And that was despite at that time the 20 year notes were already offering around 20 basis points, more than 30 year US treasuries. So now that the size of this auction has been increased, we might get some of that unless investors are speculating that power will come dovish at the Jackson Hole and then they will add the duration and try to position for lower rates coming in the future. Yeah, you bring in two key points there. The timing of the auction is a bit awkward as well ahead of Jackson Hole on Friday. And what is Jackson Hole set to deliver? Was the article over the weekend from so-called Fed whisperer, the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timmerhouse, was it some kind of indication on what the Fed is set to deliver? The speculation in his article was that we should get used to a higher sort of longer term rate on average from the Fed. The era of low rates may be overdue to high productivity and higher deficits. I suspect the latter is far more important than the former unless AI really is set to deliver some profound gains in coming years. So with that higher neutral rate, are we set for a Jackson Hole that sort of queues up a September FOMC that sees the Fed actually not indicating any sort of urgency around further rate hikes here in the near term, but that it sees that the longer term rate is higher. And if we look back at the June dot plot, we see this sort of 2.5% area median for the long term dot plot assumption of the projection of the Fed funds rate. Could that be raised to 3% or higher? That would be a very significant, I think, message to the market, even if Powell is fairly mum on any further plans to hike in the near term. So of course there's two way risk, but that article would tend to suggest that they are set for some sort of reassessment of the longer term policy rate. And one of the tweets he mentions, just the facts, ma'am, if you will, from what he's saying, he says, look, it's worth noting on that projection of the longer run interest rate that in June, seven of 17 officials were above the median rate and three were below it. Whereas a year earlier, eight were below the medium and two were above. So seven officials above the medium for the longer term rate. It's quite interesting to consider there and will be critical. I guess you would agree. I'll tell you this Jackson Hole conference, at least potentially. Absolutely, John. But I think that if we look at 10 year US Treasury yields, for example, by their face value right now, they are quite compelling. If you enter, if you buy them with a yield of 4.3 percent and you hold them until the end of 2024 and by then yields rise to 5 percent, you wouldn't make any loss. You will go flat. A real loss because of inflation, but no nominal loss on your trade there. But then if yields drop to 3.5 percent because maybe there is an upcoming recession or there is volatility in the stock market, then you will gain 13 percent. So right now, the risk reward trade off that US Treasuries provide to portfolios, it's quite good. And we cannot exclude that demand that will come as yields will rise. Key perspective there. Really key to understand the return dynamics with these very different yield levels than we were at when 10 years were yielding well sub 2 percent. So a great perspective. All right, Peter, we have NVIDIA coming up. You have this interesting angle of watching what maybe a Chinese name is saying in terms of their purchasing ahead of that. Any further thoughts on NVIDIA and your other stocks to watch today, which you have there on slide seven? No, not that you and I were talking about different scenarios for NVIDIA and we're looking at different option strategies that you could sell. You could sell a call options with a strike just above the all time high there. And then you could use that premium to fund a put and then playing on a negative surprise. That is one option, one way to express a view on NVIDIA. The pricing of those options is very slightly different today than it was yesterday. My goodness. Exactly. After a $40 move or whatever it was. We came in at almost up 9 percent with its banging very close to the highs there for NVIDIA. And it comes as analysts keep raising their revenue forecast and price targets going into this earnings release. And it is a very important, I think, event for the overall technology sector in the US. We will obviously be watching that. And before I talk about Baidu, because I think Baidu is a Chinese technology company, the equivalent of Google in the US. We have to talk about BHP Group. BHP Group obviously being one of the largest mining companies in the world. They reported slightly less than expected net income for the fiscal year that ended in June. They said in their sort of their statement that India and China right now are sources of stability in the overall commodity market. And for BHP Group, that means steel and iron ore, which is their core business, or iron ore for steelmaking. But then they also say they expect more inflation. They're not seeing that easing. And then the labor tightness will continue to impact cost. So as I said to you, John, well, it's fine that we're talking about these lower PPIs and everyone is saying, OK, inflation, we've turned a corner. But you have a pretty significant input cost to the economy. Steel, also important for wind turbines, important for construction, etc. And here you have one of the largest players in that industry basically saying that inflation is not going away and we have too much labor tightness to keep costs in check. So I think that's a very interesting comment if you are setting your portfolios and you believe that we can return to low inflation here anytime soon. Talking about earnings and the earnings watch, it's on slide 8 in today's slide deck. I've put in the Baidu's quarterly earnings figures and those estimates from on the Bloomberg terminal there. And yeah, so for the quarter that ended in June, the market analysts are expecting 12% growth on the top line. And I will be looking into the cash flow statements because the cash flow statement will show what has been spent on capital expenditures. And then we can compare that to previous quarters and then we can infer, hopefully, a little bit what has been the marginal shift in CapEx over that quarter that is going to be so important, which will overlap with two months with NVIDIA's and hopefully based on that I can write a preview leading into NVIDIA. I know it's a very single specific event in equities and this doesn't really mean a lot in the overall macro picture. That means a lot for a lot of speculative activity out there and general market psychology. Yeah, it's actual clients. I mean, it's the second most held and I think traded stock among all of our clients. So it's only surpassed by Tesla. Right. Let's go to the macro calendar. I don't want to focus too much on things except these preliminary PMIs could be quite interesting from around the world, really, but especially for the eurozone tomorrow and perhaps as well the UK with that services PMI getting close to sort of the expansion versus contraction area around 50, as far as I recall, at least for the July figure. We have this BRICS summit starting today and the focus there, I'm not expecting any dramatic announcement that's going to send the dollar headed south anytime soon. There's a lot of talk about this BRICS summit and long term proposals for some way to trade outside the US dollar system, but it could just be interesting as a measure of what kind of solidarity is developing among the BRICS and the degree to which they're able to expand the role of countries, the number of countries that are joining this organization. There are quite a few in attendance there. So be watching for headlines around that. But it really is about this Jackson Hole conference on Friday and what the Fed is set to deliver. That is the number one thing we should be focusing on and what it brings in the wake of it. So just have that on your radar and then in terms of market volatility, of course, the Nvidia results after the close on Wednesday could shake up markets, certainly in the near term. So with that said, stay safe out there and we'll be back tomorrow with the next Saxo Market Call.
